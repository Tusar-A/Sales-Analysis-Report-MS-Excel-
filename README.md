# Sales-Analysis-Report(MS Excel)

This is a 4-year sales analysis dashboard I built in Excel to track performance across products, regions, and customer segments. The goal was to make the data easy to explore while highlighting key KPIs like total profit, top-selling product, and market trends.<br>

How I Built It<br>
I wanted this dashboard to feel intuitive and actionable, so I followed a clear process:<br>
1.	Planning: I started by mapping out the key questions the dashboard needed to answer, total profit, best-performing product, top country, and sales trends over time.
2.	Data Cleaning: Removed null and missing cells, eliminated duplicates, and fixed incorrect data types so everything was reliable.
3.	Chart Creation: Built individual charts for sales by product, region, and discounts. Added logical filters to make them interactive.
4.	Dynamic Features: I used logics and formulas to make the dashboard fully dynamic, one click updates everything.
5.	Dashboard Assembly: Combined all visuals into one clean layout that gives a full snapshot of performance.

Key Insights from the Dashboard<br>
•	Total Profit (2016–2019): $87M+<br>
•	Top Product: Paseo dominated every year.<br>
•	Top Country: Mexico consistently led in revenue and growth.<br>
•	Best Year: 2019 saw the highest order volume and revenue recovery.<br>
•	Discount Strategy: Heavy discounts for government clients drove volume but hurt margins in 2018.<br>
•	Sales Trends: Growth in 2017, dip in 2018, strong recovery in 2019.<br><br>


Why This Matters<br>
This project shows my ability to:<br>
•	Transform raw data into a business story.<br>
•	Building a dashboard that’s not just pretty, but functional and decision-ready.<br>
•	Spot actionable insights, like profit leaks from discounts or untapped potential in certain markets.<br>
